# **Nasim Koohestani - Portfolio Website**

Welcome to my **Portfolio Website**! This is a personal, professional space where I showcase my work, skills, and projects in software development, specifically focused on **Frontend Development**, **Backend Technologies**, and **System Programming**.

## **About This Project**

This **portfolio website** is designed to give visitors an overview of who I am as a developer, with a focus on my skills, experience, and the projects I’ve worked on. The site is **responsive**, **accessible**, and styled with a **modern, feminine tech** aesthetic. It is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** (with Flexbox and Grid) for layout and styling

  - Project images
  - Descriptions of each project
  - Links to the GitHub repositories and live demos
- **Contact Section**: Easy-to-find links to my **LinkedIn** and **GitHub** profiles for further connection.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML**: Structuring the content and building the layout.
- **CSS**: Styling with modern design patterns, including **glassmorphism** and **flex/grid layouts**.
